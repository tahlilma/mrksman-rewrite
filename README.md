# Mrksman Rewrite
This is a shitty partial rewrite of marksman to move it from using my Discord JS 12 command handler [Commander](https://github.com/tahlilma/commander) to Discord JS 13 with all the commands being reliant on the slash commands system instead of using the message event. This version of the bot does not have a command handler and the closest thing it has to that is a fucking switch statement. I just wrote this in an effort to learn Discord JS 13 and figure out how things work. I might move this version to prod if i feel like it (or if discord does something that breaks the original mrksman based on Discord JS 12) but for now this is gonna stay here collecting dust. I might even update it from time to time and add an actually functional command handler. This bot has all the features that the original DJS 12 Mrksman has and it actually does some things better. But like I said I dont have any plans of using this as the main prod version. Mainly since slash commands are kinda inconvenient and janky compared to the battle tested message event. So for now this will just be a experiment.
